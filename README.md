# modellwerkstatt werkbank 2025 for java 17

A Java-based RAD toolchain built on JetBrains MPS for modeling business applications end-to-end.

---

## Why werkbank?

modellwerkstatt werkbank lets you build custom business software by modeling, not by wiring frameworks. You describe UI, domain logic, and persistence with domain-specific languages (DSLs) that look and feel like Java, and werkbank generates clean Java you can run on multiple UI stacks. The result: faster delivery, consistent architecture, and software that stays easy to understand and evolve.

## Highlights

* 3 integrated DSLs for data access, domain/process logic, and UI (no extra editors needed)
* Model once, generate many – produce plain Java for multiple runtime targets
* Consistent architecture across apps by construction
* Technology independence – swap UI toolkits, DBs, or servers with minimal churn
* Open source – built on JetBrains MPS and implemented in Java

## Architecture & Technology Independence

werkbank generates plain Java from your models. Out of the box you can target:

* Lightweight HTTP client with HTML frontend (great for mobile)
* Rich client based on JavaFX (excellent developer experience)
* Vaadin web client (v 23+)
* API Endpoints as servlets
* Cron jobs for time controlled execution

Because models are technology-neutral, you can replace runtimes or enhance generators without rewriting business logic.

## Why model-driven with werkbank?

* Spend time on business logic, not plumbing
* Ship faster with consistent patterns and generated code
* Keep options open: swap UI stacks, change DBs, or target new platforms without a rewrite
